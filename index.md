In this work, we are trying to apply dimensionality reduction techniques to make better visualizations of inner representations of pretrained U-Net models. The final goal of this work is to create a tool that can help to explore the domain shift problem in a given U-Net model.

This article proposes an unsupervised algorithm that can outline a brain tumor by reconstructing model-internal representation of the brain without a tumor and comparing it to the actual MRI scan. The main part of the algorithm is a deep learning-based variational autoencoder. It is trained with augmented healthy brain MRI scans from BraTS 2019 dataset for which, the autoencoder learns to reconstruct the healthy images. Given unhealthy brain MRI scan, i.e. image containing tumor, autoencoder returns a healthy version of it. By calculating residual between two images and applying Gaussian Mixture Model we are able to outline the tumor on a scan.

Parser for [resuege.ru](www.reshuege.ru) website.
Created as a part of a lab project at Kazan Federal Univercity for ease the process of test completion on the web site. 
The program parses entire database of questions form the website and provides interface for questions filtering and selection.
Questions and answers then compiled into csv format for further processing.
